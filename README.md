# SFML Game test

An extremely basic top down shooter game with health, enemies and equippable weapons, slowly getting the hang of C++ but still no seperate header files are used, as always everything is stuffed in the Main.cpp
however classes are used to make it slightly more "modular"

Could not figure out joystick support, the triggers count as axes? 
will get it done by the next rendition or just in a new project altogether

Sprite and texture concepts were used but in a very introductory manner, still need to figure out animation and scrolling levels [16-09-2024]
